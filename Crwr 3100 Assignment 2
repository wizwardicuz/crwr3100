The chill of the ice bag on my cheek seeps into the warm bruise currently darkening my cheek.
She hit me a little softer today.
I'm uncertain if I'll miss the marks when she finally warms up to me.

*Ha, warms. She doesn't need anymore heat.*

My phone rings, an old rotary model from the 1930's with gold filigree and a curved conical receiver head.
I put down the ice pack and my cheek burns as I pick up the phone.

"Hello," I grin.
"You better have good news."

"Project Gamma is going as planned,"
My trusted lieutenant gruffs into my ear.

"Oh joy!"
 I laugh, only to rub my cheek as it twinges with pain.
 "You know what to do.
 Keep them happy and quiet until I arrive."

 "Of course, Boss." The line clicks as he hangs up.
