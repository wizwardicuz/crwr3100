I hate my father.
I knew he loved money, but I did not expect this.
He fucking sold me, to the 'Handed Ones' no less.

The wagon rumbles beneath me.
They put me here, like I'm just more cargo.
The forest goes by slowly, the horses barely trotting.
I'm bored.

It's spring, which I'm glad for.
Sun beams through the branches, lighting up the moss and ferns that hide under the tall imposing trees.

They are outmatched by my guard, however.
Sitting down, they are taller than me standing straight up.
Like every Handed one, they are covered head to toe.
Layers of cloth topped by a heavy hooded robe, in their case, a soft sky blue.
The only parts ever seen are their softly glowing eyes.
Even their hands, with which they communicate, are gloved.
Grasped in theirs is a bolt rifle.
Their orange eyes, like tiny suns, scan the forest.

"So, what did you do to get stuck with me?
Do you really think I'm going to escape?"

They don't move, make any acknowledgement.
I stand up and the gun immediately swings into my face.
I push it away and sit back down.
"Okay, touchy."

I pull my knees to my chest.
I cross my legs.
I face forwards.
Backwards.
I lay back, and immediately regret the hard coins that meet my spine.
I sigh.

I roll over, look up at the spire that is my guard.
"Okay, how about this?
What's your name?
Mine's Erica."

There's a beat. They set down their gun. They twist and move their hands. I shake my head.
"I don't understand."

They still, retract a hand, pointing with the other.
Their body shifts, almost like they deflate.
The tip of one finger glows like a candle and they drag it through the air to spell out 'Sarah.'

Suddenly, the word is gone and my world is darker.
Sarah's immense shadow looms over me as she stands at her full seven feet, holding her rifle.
A burst of light and sound explode from the gun.
An arc of electricity crackles and is gone.

Shaking, my hair on end, I peek over the edge.
On the ground, a horse, its masked rider, an exploded bolt rifle beside them.

I rush back to where I was sitting.
My knees once again held against my chest, I resist the urge to sob.
Sarah sits down.
While her shadow is gone, its cold weight remains.
I try to look anywhere else, but my eyes are stuck to her gun.

"Are... Are they dead?"

She shakes her head.

"Okay."
My breaths come a little steadier, but my heart remains taught.
I rest my chin on my knees.

I hear something move and I'm pulled sideways into an embrace.
Sarah's body is huge and warm.
Against her immobile frame, I feel just how shaken I am.
My whole body trembles.

Sarah strokes my head, silent.
In this void, I feel how soft her clothes are.
Navy strips of cashmere, held with brass pins, wrap her body.
She places her chin on my head and I have to resist the urge to feel safe.

"Why?"

She writes in the air again.
'Better?' it asks.

My jaw moves, but no words come out.
I want to feel trapped, by my father, by her.
But she holds me just tight enough I know I can escape.

I throw myself away from her.
My breath is ragged.

"I'm... why. Tell me, you- You are so confusing."
A shiver assaults me.
I hug myself and sit down.

Sarah moves to write again.

"No, please. I want to *talk* to you.
Can you do that?"

She stops.
Her body, her menace appears to grow.
Her eyes glow brighter.
Noiseless, she empties the bolt rifle, reloads, checks the scope and turns away from me.

"Okay, forget I asked."

--

Sarah makes no more attempts to interact with me.
She feels colder than when she first loaded me on the wagon.
We brake for camp, eat some kind of soup from a pot in a campfire.
The others spread out, some standing guard while others pitch tents.
It's a cluster of coloured robes, moving and shifting with grace and precision.

Despite her atmosphere, Sarah stays with me.
The other wagon guards are pitching tents, everyone else having traded jobs.
Confusion blurs my thoughts.

"I guess you're stuck with me then?"
I try to joke, no doubt smiling awkwardly.

No reaction.
I sigh.
She puts a hand on my shoulder and guides me to one of the larger tents, this one the same colour as her robe.
She signs to the one who constructed it and he moves on to build another.

Sarah pushes me inside.
I land on a pile of indigo blankets.
I note the second pile, but see Sarah hasn't joined me.
She sits down by the entrance, not looking at me.
With nothing else to do, I lay down, try to sleep.
It doesn't come.

The moons are just cresting over the tops of the trees.
Stars shimmer, galaxies and planets spin overhead.
It's beautiful, but my mind is elsewhere.

*Is this really my life now?
Better than being on the run, I guess.
But why any of this?
Who bought me, what for?*
I roll over, flip, look at Sarah.
A pit forms in my stomach.
The blanket beside me is still undisturbed.

I sit up, reach out, tap her shoulder.

Like lightning, she is beside me.
One hand on my back, the other holding a cold blade to my throat.
I gulp, the thin edge scratching my skin.
Her orange eyes bore into me.

"Gods, I'm sorry.
I just..."
A tear falls down my cheek.

She flicks it away with her knife.
I feel my rapid heartbeat reverberate through my body.
I shake, the hard steel burning where it touches me.
Something wet trails down my neck and I'm too scared to see if it's sweat, tears or blood.
Sarah's eyes capture mine.

"I just wanted to apologize.
I offended you, when you were trying to comfort me.
I'm just scared, alone and confused.
You confuse me.
Am I not someone's property now?
Why do you care?"
I shake my head.
"It doesn't matter.
I'm not going to ask you to talk again."

Those tiny suns stare at me, harsh and hot.
She looks so deeply, I can feel my flesh, bones and soul laid bare to her.
I can't breathe, everything is still.
The fine blade is still ever present at my throat. And then it's gone, spinning and vanishing between her fingers.

The glow of her eyes soften.
She moves over to the second pile of blankets in seconds.
No one comes to replace her watch over me.

I peek out of the tent.
A rainbow of fabric blows in the night breeze, but none are the distinctive robes.
I could run if I wanted.
No one could stop me.
I glance at Sarah. 

*No food, no money.
I don't know where I am and have nowhere to go.
Still trapped.*

I lay down in my own blankets and fall asleep.
