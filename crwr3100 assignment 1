# CRWR 3100 Assignment 1

When I begged for a promotion, this is not what I wanted.
I push my paddle through the water, my arms burning from exertion.
I'm in the amazon, many miles from home, comfort and familiarity.
My only companion is the creepily silent translator sitting gun in hand behind me.

A mosquito flies by and lands on my arm.
I squash it, then quickly reach for my bug spray and apply another liberal coat over my exposed skin.
Yeah, not what I wanted.

I expected to work in an embassy, perhaps as a secretary or assistant to the ambassador.
Being sent to settle a land dispute with a local tribe, when I didn't even 'speak' the language, was not on my bucket list.

"Fucking idiots at the top don't give a shit,"
I grumble, pushing my paddle into the water with a little more vigor.

I swivel to face the translator, Sarah, I think her name is.
I'm too scared to ask if I'm wrong.
"Tell me, you're the only one who can talk to them, right?"

She nods.

"So you've been to all the talks. How many of them went well, for either side?"

She tilts her head, then holds up three fingers.

"Oh joy."

For a brief moment, I consider asking if she can speak, but I quickly turn back to paddling.
My face burns in preemptive embarrassment.

A quiet tap on my shoulder stills my strokes and I see Sarah's shadow fall on me as she stands and shoulders her rifle.
Covering my ears doesn't stop them from ringing as she fires into the water, a crack and splash that sends birds flying and a dark blur shifting away from the river.
I watch her as she sits down regally, smiles and then mimes a caiman.

"Just a warning shot?"

A nod.

My face burns again, but I can't hold it back this time.
I wait a moment, then blurt out, "Can you talk?
You've been quiet this whole trip."

She just stares at me, and without looking, empties the rifle chamber.

"Fine, forget I asked."

--

We've been here for a week and tomorrow we're set to arrive at the village.
My mind spins in my tent as I carefully plan what to say, my document on my laptop sitting half complete.

"I don't know what I'm doing," I say, closing my computer it with a groan. "How can I talk with these people, when I can't even *talk* to them?"

My eyes flick to the sleeping form of Sarah beside me.
My hand is over her shoulder before I even realize and I hesitate.

*Should I?*

I give her a gentle nudge.
Her eyes fly open and she rushes upward, pulling a knife from nowhere, stopping just before she hits my neck.
I look her in the eyes and give my best apologetic smile.

"It's just me, I'm sorry. I kind of need your help."

She tilts her head, but doesn't move the knife.

"How do you sign 'Hello'?"

She looks at me so deeply I feel my flesh, bones and soul laid bare to her.
I can't breathe, the cold edge of the knife still ever present at my throat.

Slowly, she pulls it away.
She spins it between her fingers and it vanishes.

She flattens her hands and lays them palm down in front of her.
Slowly, she flips them down and over, leaving them palm up, one on top of the other.

"Oh."

She signs again and this time, I try and follow her.
She swaps my hands when I finish, shaking her head.

"Does doing it wrong mean anything bad?"

She flicks her knife back into existence.

"Okay, really bad, got it."

It vanishes and she smiles.

"Thank you. I think that's all I need. I might ask you more in the morning, is that okay?"

She nods, then falls over.
She's snoring in seconds.

I turn back to my computer and flip it open.

"Okay, let's get this done."

--

We're standing at the gate to the village.
It's made of two tall trees marked with pigment.
Beyond it, I can see the tribe members forming together to meet me.
Were it not for Sarah beside me, I think I would have pissed my pants long ago.
But she's scarier than anything my mind can think of on its own.

The tribe approaches and the oldest one, leaning on a staff, signs something to Sarah.
She scribbles down the greeting into her notebook and leans it towards me.

*Welcome, we are told you are to be our new ambassador.
I am The Elder.*

Sarah looks at me, waiting.
I shuffle my feet, take a few breaths and do my best to sign the phrase I had been practicing with her all morning.

*Hello, I am Erica.
I will do my best.*

The Elder looks at me, surprised.
He signs quickly to Sarah and she signs back, neither making anything I recognize, not that I would at the speeds they are going.

When the conversation finishes, he taps his staff on the ground twice and whistles a few notes.
Then, he clears his throat and says in a very quiet, hoarse voice,

"You will do nicely."
He turns around and begin to lead the tribe back to the village.

"What?" I saw, my jaw slack.

Sarah taps me on the shoulder before passing me to join the tribe.
"C'mon, or you'll lose all the good will you just earned."

"What? You talk?"

She turns around and smiles. "Only to those who earn their trust."

--

When we arrive in the village, we are brought to the elder's house.
It's more of a roof on sticks, no walls.
The elder sits in a hammock hanging from branches allowed to breech the ceiling.
We are handed bowls of fruit, which I watch Sarah carefully devour one by one as mine sits uneaten in front of me.
I face the elder, who is looking at me with amusement.

"You can speak Spanish?"

He grins. "I can speak as many tongues as Sarah."

I look to her and she holds up seven fingers, then goes back to eating.

"So, I'm here now, what's the problem?"

The Elder's smile falls.

"This is not a new problem, just a continuation of a very ancient one, as Sarah very well knows."

I give Sarah a glance and she nods.

"Why aren't you the ambassador again?"

"No brain for politics."

He coughs. "Anyways, there is a part of the forest we hunt in the country has illegally entered and deforested.
There is no treaty we signed to say they own anything there."
