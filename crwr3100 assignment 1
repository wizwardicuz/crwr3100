# CRWR3100 Assignment 1

When I begged for a promotion, this is not what I wanted.
I push my paddle through the water, my arms burning from exertion.
I'm in the amazon, many miles from home, comfort and familiarity.
My only companion is the creepily silent translator sitting gun in hand behind me.

A mosquito flies by and lands on my arm.
I squash it, then quickly reach for my bug spray and apply another liberal coat over my exposed skin.
Yeah, not what I wanted.

I expected to work in an embassy, perhaps as a secretary or assistant to the ambassador.
Being sent to settle a land dispute with a local tribe, when I didn't even speak the language, was not on my bucket list.

"Fucking idiots at the top don't give a shit,"
I grumble, pushing my paddle into the water with a little more vigor.

I swivel to face the translator.
"Tell me, you're the only one who can talk to them, right?"

She nods.

"So you've been to all the talks. How many of them went well, for either side?"

She tilts her head then holds up three fingers.

"Oh joy."

For a brief moment, I consider asking if she can talk, but I quickly turn back to paddling.
My face burns in preemptive embarrassment.

A quiet tap on my shoulder stills my strokes and I see the shadow of the translator fall on me as she stands and shoulders her rifle.
 Covering my ears doesn't stop them from ringing as she fires into the water, a crack and splash that sends birds flying and a dark blur shifting away from the river.
I watch her as she sits down regally, smiles and then mimes a caiman.

"Just a warning shot?"

A nod.

My face burns again, but I can't hold it back this time.
I wait a moment, then blurt out, "Can you talk?
You've been quiet this whole trip."
