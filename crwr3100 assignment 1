I hate my father.
I knew he loved money, but I did not expect this.
He fucking sold me, to the 'Handed Ones' no less.

The wagon rumbles beneath me.
They put me here, like I'm just more cargo.
The forest goes by slowly, the horses barely trotting.
I'm bored.

It's spring, which I'm glad for.
Sun beams through the branches, lighting up the moss and ferns that hide under the tall imposing trees.

They are outmatched by my guard, however.
Sitting down, they are taller than me standing straight up.
Like every Handed one, they are covered head to toe.
Layers of cloth topped by a heavy cloak, in their case, a soft sky blue.
The only parts ever seen are their softly glowing eyes.
Even their hands, with which they communicate, are gloved.
Grasped in theirs is a bolt rifle.
Their orange eyes, like tiny suns, scan the forest.

"So, what did you do to get stuck with me?
Do you really think I'm going to escape?"

They don't move, make any acknowledgement.
I stand up and the gun immediately swings into my face.
I push it away and sit back down.
"Okay, touchy."

I pull my knees to my chest.
I cross my legs.
I face forwards.
Backwards.
I lay back, and immediately regret the hard coins that meet my spine.
I sigh.

I roll over, look up at the spire that is my guard.
"Okay, how about this?
What's you name?
Mine's Erica."

There's a beat. They set down their gun. They twist and move their hands. I shake my head.
"I don't understand."

They still, retract a hand, pointing with the other.
Their body shifts, almost like they deflate.
The tip of one finger glows like a candle and they drag it through the air to spell out 'Sarah.'

Suddenly, the word is gone and my world is darker.
Sarah's immense shadow looms over me as she stands at her full seven feet, holding her rifle.
A burst of light and sound explode from the gun.
An arc of electricity crackles and is gone.

Shaking, my hair on end, I peek over the edge.
On the ground, a horse, its masked rider, an exploded bolt rifle beside them.

I rush back to where I was sitting.
My knees once again held against my chest, I resist the urge to sob.
Sarah sits down.
While her shadow is gone, I still dark and cold.
I try to look anywhere else, but my eyes are stuck to her gun.

"Are... Are they dead?"

She shakes her head.

"Okay." My chest relaxes, tension leaving my body.
I rest my chin on my knees.

I hear something move and I'm pulled sideways into an embrace.
Sarah's body is huge and warm.
She holds me tightly.
Against her immobile frame, I feel just how shaken I am.
My whole body trembles.

Sarah strokes my head, but is still silent.
In this void, I feel how soft her clothes are.
Navy strips of cashmere, held with brass pins, wrap her body.
She rests her chin on my head and I have to resist the urge to feel safe.

"Why?"
