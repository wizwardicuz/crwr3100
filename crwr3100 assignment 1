When I begged for a promotion, this is not what I wanted.
I push my paddle through the water, my arms burning from exertion.
I'm in the amazon, many miles from home, comfort and familiarity.
My only companion is the creepily silent translator sitting gun in hand behind me.

A mosquito flies by and lands on my arm.
I squash it, then quickly reach for my bug spray and apply another liberal coat over my exposed skin.
Yeah, not what I wanted.

I expected to work in an embassy, perhaps as a secretary or assistant to the ambassador.
Being sent to settle a land dispute with a local tribe, when I didn't even speak the language, was not on my bucket list.

"Fucking idiots at the top don't give a shit,"
I grumble, pushing my paddle into the water with a little more vigor.

I turn to the translator.
